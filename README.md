# Palindrome-Birthday
A Web Application in Vanilla JS which checks your birthday is palindrome or not.

The user will enter their birthday and the output will show their birthday is palindrome or not.
If its not a palindrome, the program will tell by how many days it missed. It could be previous or next days depending on lesser count.
